# Biostat 625: Final Group Project Github

**Analyzing Features Driving User Preferences and Reviews to Recipes on Food.com**

**Group 3: Jiayu Zhang, Cynthia Zajac, Rupam Bhattacharyya**

This repository works as a stand-aside for our project report. Due to issues with uploading large files to GitHub, we are only including the smaller processed data files and environments and the python and R codes to execute the processing and analyses.

The folder structure and the contents of each folder should be pretty evident from their naming.

1. *Codes -* includes all the codes to generate the results. Subfolders are as per subsections in the report.
2. *Data and Processing -* contains the files pertinent to the processing of the data, especially the text reviews.
3. *Results -* has all the figures and tables included in the report separately.

Since the data files could not be uploaded, we kept the names in the R calls consistent with the [source](https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions). Instructions on which files to use for which part of the analysis are either evident from the read calls or are added as comments within the codes.

Lastly, a little bit of honest confession - the original github where we were working was too messy with all the different commits and failed attempts etc., so we cleaned up and organized the codes locally and decided to submit a new and fresh directory!
